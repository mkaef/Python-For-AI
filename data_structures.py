Data structures
Store multiple values together

Beyond single values
So far, you’ve stored one value per variable. But what if you need to store multiple values? That’s where data structures come in.
Think of data structures as containers:
Lists: Like a shopping list (ordered items)
Dictionaries: Like a phone book (name > number)
Tuples: Like coordinates (fixed values)
Sets: Like a bag of unique items
